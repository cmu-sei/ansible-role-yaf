yaf
=========

A role for installing, configuring, and managing the YAF service.  YAF is Yet Another Flowmeter. It processes packet data from pcap dumpfiles as generated by tcpdump or via live capture from an interface using pcap into bidirectional flows, then exports those flows to IPFIX Collecting Processes or in an IPFIX-based file format. YAF's output can be used with the SiLK flow analysis tools, super_mediator, Pipeline, and any other IPFIX compliant toolchain. See yaf [documentation](https://tools.netsa.cert.org/yaf/docs.html) for more information.
